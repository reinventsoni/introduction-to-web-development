    <h1>HTML Primer</h1>
    <p>In this module we will learn about HTML from the very basics and cover all the concepts and its implementations.</p>
    <div>
    <h2>HTML Introduction</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used to specify what the content of a particular webpage will be and the structure in which the content will be arranged. </p>
    <p>Let's think about it, on a typical webpage we have following type of contents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Headings: a content would have main headings, followed by various subheadings</li>
        <li>Paragraphs: there also needs be a blob of running text or paragraph, for which headings are specified.</li>
        <li>Links:there are texts (as well as images, buttons) on the webpage which when clicked leads to either new websites, different pages on the same website or to a different section on the same webpage.</li>
        <li>Tables and Lists: the information can be arranged in the tables, or there may be need to arrange the data in ordered and unordered lists. </li>
        <li>Inputs Elements / Selection Elements:many a times we need to enter the information on webpages or select 
            from the pre-configured options on a webpage. For e.g.:
            <ul>
                <li>Email Address, First Name, Last Name, Cell No. etc. to be provided as an input on a Form</li>
                <li>Date and Time Selections</li>
                <li>File Selection for File Uploads</li>
                <li>Radio Buttons to select one option, or checkbox to select multiple options. /li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
        <li>Multimedia Elements: we are all used to access videos, images, GIFs, SVGs on modern webapps, so HTML must have provision for these contents as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not only the contents, but Web Pages also has various structural elements in it for e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Headers and Footers</li>
        <li>Navigation Menu</li>
        <li>Left-Hand or Right-Hand Content Panels for some specific piece of contents like Advertisements, Promotions, Banners, Promoted Blogs etc.</li>
        <li>Code Snippets, Pre-formatted Contents</li>
        <li>Distinct Sections on a Webpage for e.g. Hero Section, Contact Us Section, Project Highlights, Testimonials etc.</li>
        <li>Different paragraph groupings for various text blurbs </li>
    </ul>
    <p>HTML supports all the different types of contents as highlighted above. Additionally, it has features to structure, arrange or group the contents into various semantic contexts.</p>
    <code>So just to summarize, HTML specify the content and structure of a webpage</code>
    <p>Its also prudent to make a distinction that HTML itself is not a programming language per say, as it doesn’t contain any logic. HTML contains markups, which can be considered as encoding or symbols which give certain meaning to the text enclosed within them for e.g., &lt;p&gt; and &lt;H1&gt;. These are also referred to as tags.</p>
    <p>If you are interested, there is a detailed explanation on why its refered to as <em>hypertext</em> and <em>markup</em>, and the history of evolution of HTML covered by MDN Web Docs at the following location:</p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">MDN Blog</a>
    <p>With this now out of the way, this is the right time to understand the Anatomy of HTML</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Anatomy of HTML Elements</h2>
    <p>From the development perspective let's align on some terminologies. We will use the term <b>HTML Document</b> to refer to a webpage. So the single wepbage which is displayed in a browser corresponds to the HTML document which is created by a developer and it may be a static webpage or a dynamic webpage (more on that later). </p>
    <p>A webpage or HTML document consists of series of “HTML Elements” which we use to markup different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. This markup is usually done by enclosing the content is some predefined tags. For e.g. the code below will result into the following output</p>
    <code>&lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph content &lt;\p&gt;</code>
    <code><p>This is a paragraph content</p></code>
    </div>
    <p>The following image highlights the different parts of the HTML element which we just used in the example above:</p>
    <img src="../../images/HTML Element Illustration.png" alt="HTML Element Explanation">
    <p>As we can see there are various parts associated with a HTML elements, and they are:
         <ul>
            <li><b>Opening Tag:</b> The start of the HTML element we specific the opening tag. It takes for the form of <b>&lt; TagName &gt;</b></li>
            <li><b>Closing Tag:</b> In most of the cases (yes there are few exception where we don't need closing tag) closing tag is also included and it takes the form of <b>&lt; /TagName &gt;</b></li>
            <li><b>Content</b>: And enclosed within the tags is the actual content (or text) that will be displayed on the webpage</li>
        </ul>
        All these parts together are referred to as an <b>HTML Element</b>
    </p>
    <p>Just for completeness, I would like to call out that we can additionally specify the attributes as <strong> key = value </strong> pair for various tags, but we will look at it in the respective sections when we deal with individual tags and later on when we use CSS to style our webpages.</p>
    
    <p>Now that we have understood what the anatomy of individual HTML elements look like, let's also understand the structure / anatomy of the webpage or HTML Document itself.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Anatomy of HTML Document</h2>
        <p>Any HTML Document would have following structure: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DOCTYPE declaration:</strong> All the HTML Documents should start with the declaration <strong> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong>. This tells the browser that the document which it is going to render is a HTML document. 
            This declaration also highlights what HTML version this document is, and as a result also highlights what are the allowed tags. </li>
            <li><strong>HTML Element: </strong>After the doctype declaration this is the root element of HTML Webpage. Everything else is encapsulated within the HTML element.</li>
            <li><strong>HEAD element:</strong>The header section of the HTML document which is declared using the element <strong>&lt;head&gt;....&lt;/head&gt;</strong> is used to 
            define the metadata of the webpage i.e. data about the HTML page itself. Metadata typically defines the document title, character set, styles, scripts and various other meta information as needed.
            As a minimum we should specify Title, Character Set and Viewport when defining the head element of a webpage. These are defined as follow:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>&lt;title&gt;The Title of the Webpage&lt;/title&gt;:</strong> The title appears on the Browser Tab when the webpage is opened in the browser</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" &gt;:</strong> This element tells the browser the character encoding which is used in the HTML document. Most of the time UTF-8 is sufficient, but there may be instances 
                    when other character encoding may have to be used for e.g. when we are dealing with regional languages.</li> 
                    <li><strong>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" &gt;:</strong></li>
                    <p>Observe that for meta element we have additional specified the <strong>key="value"</strong> information, these are known as tag attributes.
                    Different tags have different tag attributes associated with them. We will cover them in the subsequent section. Also observe that meta tag doesn't 
                    have the closing tag associated with it. There are various tags which follow these patterns i.e. they do not have Child Content node underneath them.
                    These correct technical term for these tags/elements is <strong>void elements</strong></p>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li><strong>BODY element:</strong> The body element of the HTML document is the container which contains all the visible HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, links
            tables, images. Everything which is visible when the browser opens up the webpages is specified in the body element of HTML using different HTML elements (Tags)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So a typical HTML page will always having following skeleton structure: </p>
        <img src="../../images/HTML Page Structure.png" alt="HTML Page Structure">
        <p>Now its good to remember these tags, but practically speaking you don't need to. The IDEs which are used by developers have the shortcuts
            to generate these boilerplate code. You can refer to the instructions for the respective IDE which you are using.
            In this course we are using VSCODE, and we have covered this in the demonstration.
            <code>embed video here later.</code>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>Next we will talk about the HTML tags which we will use within the body section of our webpages.</p>
