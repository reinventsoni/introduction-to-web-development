    <h1>HTML Tags</h1>
    <p>Now that we have a basic understanding of the anatomy of the HTML document and the underlying elements, lets
        formally go through all the tags which HTML has to offer.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>1. HTML Headings</h2>
        <p>As we briefly touched in the introduction section that we need to cater for Headings and Paragraphs to structure text properly. HTML has multiple tags to cater for this.
            For Headings there are six level of heading tags which HTML provides, and they are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;H1&gt; This is Heading Level 1  &lt;/H1&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;H2&gt; This is Heading Level 2  &lt;/H2&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;H3&gt; This is Heading Level 3  &lt;/H3&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;H4&gt; This is Heading Level 4  &lt;/H4&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;H5&gt; This is Heading Level 5  &lt;/H5&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;H6&gt; This is Heading Level 6  &lt;/H6&gt;</li>
            </ul>
        and this generates the following output, the fonts and size may be little different depending on the browser default style and or the 
        custom styling applied to the webpage.
        </p>
        <H1> This is Heading Level 1 </H1>
        <H2> This is Heading Level 2 </H2>
        <H3> This is Heading Level 2 </H3>
        <H4> This is Heading Level 2 </H4>
        <H5> This is Heading Level 2 </H5>
        <H6> This is Heading Level 2 </H6>
        <p>H1 heading should be used for the main heading, H2 represent the sub-heading, H3 represent the next level of sub-heading 
        (you can call it sub-sub-heading) and so and so forth. Just one word of caution we should not over do. I donâ€™t see any reasons 
        where we may need to go to all the way to H6s, but there is a provision for it from the 
        markup language constructs point of view.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. HTML Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>Besides headings we also need running text or paragraphs, and for that we have <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> tag in HTML.  So following code segment:
            will result into following output on a HTML webpage:
        </p>
            <code>
                &lt;p&gt;
                Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Facilis quod, modi accusantium cumque ducimus consequuntur 
            voluptatum optio repellendus, nemo et at, accusamus labore soluta! Quibusdam natus sunt hic consectetur placeat? Iusto 
            fugit corporis incidunt distinctio temporibus ratione. Unde totam molestiae, repellat, repellendus modi iste inventore 
            consectetur tempore neque nam sapiente? Commodi doloribus aperiam et repellat omnis provident molestias odit ipsam?
                &lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Facilis quod, modi accusantium cumque ducimus consequuntur 
            voluptatum optio repellendus, nemo et at, accusamus labore soluta! Quibusdam natus sunt hic consectetur placeat? Iusto 
            fugit corporis incidunt distinctio temporibus ratione. Unde totam molestiae, repellat, repellendus modi iste inventore 
            consectetur tempore neque nam sapiente? Commodi doloribus aperiam et repellat omnis provident molestias odit ipsam?</p>

        <p><strong>Structure Hierarchy: </strong>It is important to maintain the structure hierarchy when we are laying down the text content
        on our webpages. If we think about following are the different areas of users and applications that will access our webpage, and we
        as developers need to make sure that content is structured in such a way that for all the below use cases it can be easily and intuitively
        accessed:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Search Engine</strong>: the crawlers of search engines when index our webpages, need to understand the content on it and in doing
                so the headings plays important part in it amongst various other factors involved in Search Engine Optimization. Without headings
                our webpage may not perform well in SEO and be found organically on the web.
            </li>
            <li><strong>CSS Javascript:</strong> we also need to structure our webpages properly so that we can use CSS to select the contents based on the 
                class and variour other selection and apply appropriate styling. Proper structure of HTML pages is also required so that
                we can access the content programatically and it requires proper tags, ids and classes etc to be in place for the elements to
                be properly targeted.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Users: </strong>We, the end users, usually do a quick scan of any webpage before we decide to spend time on a page for a detailed read.
                So it is important to have a proper structure of headings, contents, lists, quotes, etc in any document and HTML pages are 
                no exception to it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility: </strong> We should also not forget that wide variety of users who access websites may have some visual impairement, so 
                our websites should also cater to it as they will use Screen Readers to read the content of website. In that regards it is important
                that we use proper tags for e.g. &lt;emphasis&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; wherever require. Also a proper use of semantic tags is 
                advisable. We have a section on Semantic Tags later in our course.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <H2>3. HTML Lists</H2>
        <p>We use lists extensively when we are dealing with the text content in our day to day life. Primarily speaking there are two types
            of lists:
            <ul>
                <li>Ordered Lists: where the sequence in which the content is appearing is important</li>
                <li>Unordered Lists: where the sequence itself is not important, but its better to represent the items in a list basis for clarity purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            HTML has specific tags for the types of lists.
        </p>

        <strong>Ordered List: </strong> is defined using the following tags:
        
        <p><code>
            <img src="../../images/HTML Ordered List.png" alt="Ordered List">
        </code>
        </p>
        and the above code generates a list like below:
        <p><code>  
            <img src="../../images/HTML Ordered List Output.png" alt="Ordered List output">
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>The tag usage is self explanatory but to explain -> the outer tags (opening and closing tags) are defined by 
            <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong> ... <strong>&lt;/ol&gt;</strong> respectively. ol: stands for Ordered List. Nested within these Tags
            are the individual <strong>list items</strong> which are defined by the tags <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> ... <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>,
            where li: stands for list items
        </p>

        <p>Extending the same thought process if we have to use the <b>U</b>nordered <b>L</b>ist, then one would thing that we should use the Tags
            <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong> ... <strong>&lt;/ul&gt;</strong>, and that is absolutely right.
        </p>

        <strong>Unordered List: </strong> is defined using the following tags:
        
        <p><code>
            <img src="../../images/HTML Unordered List.png" alt="Ordered List">
        </code>
        </p>
        and the above code generates a list like below:
        <p><code>  
            <img src="../../images/HTML Unordered List Output.png" alt="Ordered List output">
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>By the way in this context, tags <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> ... <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong> are said to be nested elements or child of the 
        tags <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong> ... <strong>&lt;/ul&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong> ... <strong>&lt;/ol&gt;</strong> 
        as the case may be.</p>

        <h2>4. HTML Hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>Hyperlinks refer to a web-content, like texts, images, buttons that can be linked to a section on the same webpage, or a different webpage on
            the same website, or for that matter an entirely different website altogether. Basic Anatomy of a hyperlink tag is as follows:
        </p>
        <code><img src="../../images/HTML A Tag Anatomy.png" alt="Anatomy of Hyperlink Tag"></code>
        <p>So as you can see it has: 
        <ul>
            <li>an opening &lt;a&gt; tag. Within this opening tag you also have an attribute <strong>href</strong>, where you specify the target of the link.</li>
            <li>a closing &lt;/a&gt; tag</li>
            <li>embededded within tag is a TEXT, which is what will be visible on the webpage</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
